## Final Project
# Music Player & Forum Site

A music player and forum application made for musicians and music lovers alike, that allows users to discover new and free tunes from underground artists. The app uses Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the API, which will be hooked up to a React frontend and deployed to Heroku.

# User Stories

A User should be able to:

- Login or Signup for an account, using separate forms
- Search for a song, artist, or album using the search bar
- View an album's page, which allows users to play through each track on the album
- Leave a single rating and comment for any album
- Filter music by Genre using the NavBar
- View an artist's page which shows their entire discography and any relevant information. Each album can then be displayed by clicking on the album, and the artist can be viewed by clicking the artist on the album.

# Model/Schema

# Stretch Goal(s)

- I am also considering making a user also an artist, so that they can also upload their own music. Thus, the model may change.
